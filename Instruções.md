### Instructions and Good Practices Manual

1. You can create your own folders, but I've already taken the liberty of creating some that I see are necessary. An organized repository makes the project more scalable.

2. In the 'data' folder we will have a folder to store data collected in 'external' and data already processed in 'processed'.

3. 'docs' is a folder for your free use. I usually use it to store tests and so on.

4. In the 'reports' folder you will find an ideal place to store your reports on accuracy, assertiveness, model evaluations and so on.

5. In 'src' we have two folders. 'notebooks' so that you can develop the model, if you prefer, in a notebook and separate it in an organized way. The 'models' folder is where you turn your notebook into a script before putting it into production.

6. I've left a CRISP-DM pipeline in the repository, but feel free to follow the methodology you prefer.

7. I've left a Dockerfile but feel free to delete it if you don't want to use it.

8. Create your virtual environment and, as a good practice, always feed the 'requirements.txt' with the versions of frameworks used in your project.

9. Have fun! Have fun while you work, after all, if we're here, we're doing what we love, aren't we!

Best,
