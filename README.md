### About the project

This project will cover a set of techniques used in training and testing a binary classifier using the MNIST, a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used to train various image processing systems and machine learning models. It was created by "re-mixing" samples from the original NIST datasets and has become a benchmark for evaluating the performance of image classification algorithms.

### About the dataset

#### Key features

- MNIST contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits.
- The dataset includes grayscale images of size 28x28 pixels.
- The images are normalized to fit into a 28x28 pixel bounding box and anti-aliased, introducing grayscale levels.
- MNIST is widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning, especially for image classification tasks.

#### Structure of the dataset

The MNIST dataset is divided into two subsets:

-Training set: This subset contains 60,000 images of handwritten digits used to train machine learning models.
-Test set: This subset consists of 10,000 images used to test and evaluate the trained models.
